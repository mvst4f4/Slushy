# Weather Slushy (idk what to call this)

A simple, functional weather web app coded by Mustafa.  
Hopefully cloudy with a chance of slushies.

## Description

This is a small Flask web app that allows you to:

- Check the weather in any city
- View your last 5 searched cities on the history page
- Read information about the site on the about page

The design is simple, monotone, with a white background and monospace font. Focus is on functionality and clarity.

- **Search History** – Keeps track of the last 5 cities you searched.  
- **About Page** – Provides a brief description of the site.

If you want, I can **also create the `requirements.txt` and folder structure including placeholders for screenshots** so the project is submission-ready.  

Do you want me to do that next?
